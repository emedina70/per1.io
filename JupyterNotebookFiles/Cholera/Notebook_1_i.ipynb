Data about weather is collected by weather stations and used by meteorologists to determine weather outcomes. Data about your Netflix viewing history can be used by Netflix's algorithms to recommend new movies and shows that better match your interests. \n\n<br>\n\n<table><tr>\n    <td> <img src=\"imgs/netflix-image.jpeg\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/> </td>\n    <td> <img src=\"imgs/weather-image.jpeg\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/> </td>\n</tr></table>\n\n<br>\n\n<img src=\"imgs/pencil.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" align=left style=\"width: 20px;\"/> <font size=4> **Journal 1a:** Data in YOUR world </font>\n\n**Give an example of data in your daily life, e.g. data that you collect or that’s collected about you.

One of them was **John Snow**, a physician who started recording the following information about London households:\n\n![](imgs/img-ledger.png)\n\n<!-- As you can see, there are data about the following (in order):\n- House number\n- Neighborhood\n- Occupation\n- Age\n- Symptoms\n- Water Supplier -->\n\n<img src=\"imgs/pencil.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" align=left style=\"width: 20px;\"/> <font size=4>**Journal 1b:** Taking inventory: what do we have?</font>\n\n**Describe the data you see in John Snow's notes (the photo).
